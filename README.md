# ECHO-Server

As the Python ECHO client is no longer in development, this server will no longer work. Please use https://github.com/will-scargill/echov2server

--------------------

You'll want to change the IP and port if you want to run this on anything other than localhost, I've highlighted where you need to change with comments.

--------------------

If you are running this for the first time, you will need to select option 2 before selecting option 1. Selecting option 1 without having a full config will probably crash the program
